# Earthquake Vibration Detection System

A university project developed for the Electrical Circuits course, focusing on designing a system to detect ground vibrations using piezoelectric sensors and analog circuitry.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project aims to simulate an earthquake detection system by capturing ground vibrations through a piezoelectric sensor. The analog signal from the sensor is amplified and filtered to identify significant seismic activities.

## 🛠️ Components and Tools

- **Piezoelectric Sensor**: Converts mechanical vibrations into electrical signals.
- **Operational Amplifier (LM741)**: Amplifies the sensor's output signal.
- **Resistors and Capacitors**: Used for signal filtering and circuit stability.
- **Multisim**: For circuit simulation and analysis.
- **Breadboard and Wires**: For physical prototyping.

## 🔬 Circuit Design

The system's core is a piezoelectric sensor connected to an op-amp configuration to amplify the detected vibrations. The amplified signal is then passed through a filter circuit to eliminate noise and enhance signal clarity.

## 📊 Simulation and Testing

- **Simulation**: Conducted using Multisim to validate the circuit's response to various vibration frequencies.
- **Prototyping**: Built on a breadboard to test real-world performance.
- **Results**: The system successfully detected simulated seismic vibrations, demonstrating its potential for early earthquake warning applications.
